# weather-app
This is an application that will display the weather.

## Why?
I wanted to create a lightweight weather application that utilises OpenWeather API. 

## Current TODOs:
* Improve formatting of information - Line 35
* Add an image based on the weather forecast - Line 36
* Have an option to save location
* Have an option to use users location
